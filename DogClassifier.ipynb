    "So the idea here is to make a dog classifier from the [Stanford Dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). This is basically going to be the same as the pets classifier from the Fast.ai lesson one, but includes more dogs and fewer cats. (My real motivation is that my mom likes huskies and my sister likes german shorthairs, and neither were included in the Fast.ai pet classifier.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my first time using Google Cloud and my first try at ML, so I'm going to list everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the dataset I first tried using the fastai function `untar_data`, but this threw the error `ReadError: not a gzip file` because the function expects a `.gz` and the Stanford file is `.tar`. Easy enough: I'm using Google Cloud, so I can just do: \n",
    "\n",
    "`wget http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/images.tar`\n",
    "\n",
    "and then unpack it with:\n",

    "`gcloud compute ssh --zone=$ZONE jupyter@$INSTANCE_NAME -- -L 8080:localhost:8080`\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that when I started the notebook the server was on `8889`. Reconnecting to the shell with port `8889` did the trick. (Although I'm not sure what changed from yesterday.)"
